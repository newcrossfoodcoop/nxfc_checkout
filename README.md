# nxfc_base

This is the base container for the nxfc project using alpine-node 
(mhart/alpine-node).

The intention is to also provide a cloneable base application to be able to 
quickly build new services that conform to our configuration approach.

From a versioning point of view, the major and minor versions come from 
alpine-node and the patch version will come from here.
